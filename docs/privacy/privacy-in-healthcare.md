# Introduction

Privacy in healthcare refers to the protection and confidentiality of an individual's health information and personal data in the medical field.

## Levels of Privacy

We can apply different levels of confidentiality to health data, each of which requires different approaches.

### Data Collection

At the data collection phase, randomization in the form of noise is usually added. This helps protect the individual's privacy by reducing the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Data Distribution

Privacy can be protected at the data distribution phase using technologies such as federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and secure multiparty computation. These methods ensure that health data is only shared between authorized parties and is not accessible to unauthorized third parties.

### Data Publication

During the data publication phase, anonymization is used to achieve privacy. This means that personal or sensitive identification information is removed before processing any knowledge extraction task or query. This is essential to comply with privacy regulations and protect individuals' privacy.

## Types of Health Data

Different types of health data require different privacy approaches. For example, relational patient data represents patient visits and medical diagnoses from a single hospital and requires privacy protection during the data collection and distribution phases. Graph-based health data, such as a transmission network or epidemiological graph, also requires privacy protection but may require different methods to protect privacy than relational data.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, privacy in healthcare is a complex and evolving field that requires careful consideration of the different levels of privacy and types of health data involved. It is essential to ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected and that their health information is kept confidential.
