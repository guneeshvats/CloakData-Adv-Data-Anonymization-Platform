# Design

To ensure the success of any project, it's crucial to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements, while also ensuring that the architecture of the solution is compliant with our proposed solution. To achieve this, we carefully designed the architecture of our solution, taking into consideration the requirements of the project and the stakeholders. We also created workflow sequence diagrams, which helped us to visualize the system and ensure that it was meeting the needs of the stakeholders. By doing this, we were able to ensure that the solution was not only meeting the functional and non-functional requirements but also that it was designed in a way that was compliant with industry standards and best practices. This helped to ensure that the solution was robust, scalable, and easy to maintain, while also being effective at meeting the needs of our stakeholders. Ultimately, by prioritizing architecture compliance, meeting functional and non-functional requirements, and creating the diagrams, we were able to deliver a high-quality solution that met the needs of our stakeholders and delivered real value to the organization.
